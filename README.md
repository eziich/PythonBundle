1. GlowApp - Social network web app (Final project - college)
GlowApp is a social networking web application that allows users to register and log in, upload pictures or videos, comment on posts, follow other users, and explore content. The backend is built with Python (Django), utilizing Django's ORM for database management (Sqlite), while the frontend is created using raw HTML and CSS (idea behind was improving my designing skills - so no bootstrap or anything else) with a small amount of JavaScript. This project was initially developed as a college assignment, with the main goal being to implement the key features mentioned above. Because of this, some common features like password recovery, email verification and other features are missing. I decided to publish this project on GitHub as a reminder of my college days and as a testament to my work with Python, even though I no longer actively code in it.



2. CryptoValueAnalyzer 
CryptoValueAnalyzer is a desktop application that fetches and displays real-time data for the top 3 cryptocurrencies, including their current price, 24-hour price change, market capitalization, and trading volume. The app features a tabbed interface with sections for charts, detailed information, and market behavior predictions. Its primary goal is to provide users with a concise overview of leading cryptocurrencies and offer basic predictive insights to help understand potential market trends.



3. DataAnalitics 
DataAnalitics is a desktop application that allows users to upload and analyze their own .xml data files, generating graphical analytics using Python's Tkinter library. The application presents insights through various chart types, including pie charts, bar graphs, and histograms. For testing and demonstration purposes, a sample mockdata.xml file is included in the DataAnalitics folder.


4. MonteCarloSimulation 
MonteCarloSimulation is a desktop application based on the Monte Carlo method. It allows users to upload a .csv file and run a user-defined number of simulations (default is 1000) to calculate probabilities based on the data. The application uses values defined in associated .xml files to guide the simulation logic. Two sample .xml files are included in the application folder for testing and demonstration purposes.



5. YoutubeDownloader
