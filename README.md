## 1. GlowApp - Social Network Web App (Final Project - College)

### Technologies:
- Python (Django)
- SQLite Database
- HTML, CSS (Raw Design)
- JavaScript

### Summary/Idea:
GlowApp is a social networking web application designed to allow users to register, log in, upload media, comment on posts, follow other users, and explore content. This project was built as a college assignment with the focus on implementing fundamental social media features. The backend is powered by Django's ORM with an SQLite database, and the frontend is crafted using only raw HTML and CSS to enhance design skills (no frameworks like Bootstrap were used). Although some common features (like password recovery and email verification) are missing, this project serves as a showcase of fundamental web development skills and Python/Django expertise.

## 4. MonteCarloSimulation

### Technologies:
- Python (Tkinter)
- NumPy
- CSV Parsing

### Summary/Idea:
MonteCarloSimulation is a desktop application based on the Monte Carlo method. Users can upload a .csv file containing data and define the number of simulations (default: 1000) to calculate probabilities based on that data. The app uses associated .xml files to define simulation parameters. The goal of this application is to demonstrate how the Monte Carlo method can be applied to real-world datasets to calculate the likelihood of certain outcomes.
